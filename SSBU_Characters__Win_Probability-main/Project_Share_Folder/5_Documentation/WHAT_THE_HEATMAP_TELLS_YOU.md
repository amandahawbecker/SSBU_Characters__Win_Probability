# What Does the Matchup Matrix Heatmap Tell You?

## 🎯 Simple Answer

**The heatmap shows predicted win rates between characters based on tournament data.**

---

## 📊 What Each Part Means

### **Rows (Left Side)**

- **Character 1** (the "attacking" character)
- Shows how this character performs against all others

### **Columns (Top)**

- **Character 2** (the "defending" character)
- Shows who this character faces

### **Cells (The Colors)**

- **Win rate for Character 1** against Character 2
- Number = percentage (e.g., 0.60 = 60% win rate)

---

## 🎨 What the Colors Mean

### **Green (0.6 - 1.0)**

- ✅ Character 1 **wins more often**
- Advantage for row character
- Good matchup

### **Yellow (~0.5)**

- ⚖️ **Even matchup** (50/50)
- Either character can win
- Skill matters more

### **Red (0.0 - 0.4)**

- ❌ Character 1 **loses more often**
- Disadvantage for row character
- Bad matchup

---

## 💡 Key Insights

### **1. Character Strength (Look at Rows)**

**Green Row = Strong Character**

- Wins most matchups
- Top-tier character
- Good tournament choice

**Red Row = Weak Character**

- Loses most matchups
- Lower-tier character
- Harder to win tournaments

**Mixed Colors = Balanced Character**

- Some good, some bad matchups
- Matchup-dependent

---

### **2. Specific Matchups (Look at Cells)**

**Example: Palutena vs Wolf = 0.60 (Green)**

- Palutena wins 60% of the time
- Palutena has advantage
- Good matchup for Palutena

**Example: Wolf vs Palutena = 0.40 (Red)**

- Wolf wins 40% of the time
- Wolf is disadvantaged
- Bad matchup for Wolf

**Note:** These should add up to 1.0 (60% + 40% = 100%) ✅

### **3. Tournament Strategy**

**For Players:**

- **Pick characters with green matchups** (advantage)
- **Avoid red matchups** (disadvantage)
- **Yellow is neutral** (skill matters)

**For Analysis:**

- See which characters dominate
- Identify strong/weak characters
- Understand game balance

## 📈 What Patterns to Look For

### **1. Strong Characters**

**Look for:** Rows with mostly green cells
**Example:** If Joker's row is mostly green → Strong character

### **2. Weak Characters**

**Look for:** Rows with mostly red cells
**Example:** If a character's row is mostly red → Struggles overall

### **3. Counter Characters**

**Look for:** Columns with mostly red (everyone loses to this character)
**Example:** If Cloud column is mostly red → Cloud beats many characters

### **4. Even Matchups**

**Look for:** Yellow cells (~0.5)
**Example:** Close to 50% = Competitive, skill-based matchup

## 🎯 Real Examples from Your Data

### **Example 1: Palutena (Strong Character)**

- Row shows: Mostly green/yellow cells
- **Meaning:** Palutena wins most matchups
- **Conclusion:** Strong tournament character

### **Example 2: Cloud Column**

- Column shows: Many red cells
- **Meaning:** Cloud beats many characters
- **Conclusion:** Strong counter-pick option

### **Example 3: Even Matchup**

- Cell: 0.48 - 0.52 (yellow)
- **Meaning:** Close to 50/50
- **Conclusion:** Skill matters more than character
