# Streamlit Matchup Predictor - Usage Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install Streamlit and all other required packages.

### 2. Run the Streamlit App

From the `6_Interactive_Tools` directory:

```bash
streamlit run matchup_predictor_streamlit.py
```

Or from the project root:

```bash
streamlit run 6_Interactive_Tools/matchup_predictor_streamlit.py
```

The app will automatically open in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## 📋 Features

### Tab 1: Matchup Predictor
- Select two characters from dropdown menus
- Get instant matchup predictions with confidence scores
- View detailed attribute comparisons
- See interactive charts comparing character attributes

### Tab 2: Visualizations
- View all visualizations from Pipeline A (supervised tier classification)
- Includes:
  - **Confusion Matrix**: Shows model performance on tier classification
  - **Feature Importance**: Top 15 most important features (combined permutation + tree-based importance)
  - **Model Comparison**: Performance comparison across different ML models
  - **Prediction Results**: CSV table with all character tier predictions

## 📁 Required Files

The app expects the following files to be present:

### Data Files (in `1_Data_Files/`):
- `smash.csv` - Character attributes
- `character_matchups.csv` - Tournament matchup data

### Visualization Files (generated by `pipeline_a_supervised.py`):
- `visualizations/pipeline_a_confusion_matrix.png`
- `visualizations/pipeline_a_feature_importance.png`
- `visualizations/pipeline_a_model_comparison.png`
- `results/pipeline_a_predictions.csv`

**Note:** If visualization files are not found, the app will show a message. Run `pipeline_a_supervised.py` first to generate them.

## 🔍 Feature Importance Explanation

The app shows feature importance from **multiple sources**:

### Pipeline A (Most Advanced)
- **Tree-based Feature Importance**: From Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost models
- **Permutation Importance**: More reliable method that works for all model types
- **Combined Importance**: Weighted average (60% permutation, 40% tree-based)
- This approach is already robust and doesn't need reevaluation

### Other Sources (Available in Visualizations Tab)
- **Enhanced Classifier**: From `build_enhanced_classifier.py` - includes technical parameters
- **Binary Classifier**: From `build_matchup_classifier.py` - basic attribute differences
- **Basic Model**: From `build_matchup_model.py` - regression model importance

## 📝 Which Predictor to Use?

**Recommended: `matchup_predictor_enhanced.py`** (automatically used if available)
- Uses enhanced classifier approach with technical parameters
- Better feature set (18 features vs 10)
- Falls back to `matchup_predictor_backup.py` if enhanced version not available

The Streamlit app automatically tries to use the enhanced version first.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "Could not import MatchupPredictor"
- Ensure `matchup_predictor_backup.py` is in the same directory as the Streamlit app

### "Error loading model"
- Check that `smash.csv` and `character_matchups.csv` are in `1_Data_Files/`
- Verify the CSV files are not corrupted

### "No visualization files found"
- Run `2_Model_Scripts/pipeline_a_supervised.py` first to generate visualizations
- Check that the script completed successfully
- Verify files are in `visualizations/` or `3_Visualizations/` directories

## 📊 Comparison with Original GUI

The Streamlit version offers:
- ✅ Web-based interface (no tkinter required)
- ✅ Better visualization support
- ✅ Tabbed interface for organized content
- ✅ Interactive charts and tables
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Easier to share and deploy

The original tkinter GUI (`matchup_predictor_gui.py`) is still available if you prefer a desktop application.
