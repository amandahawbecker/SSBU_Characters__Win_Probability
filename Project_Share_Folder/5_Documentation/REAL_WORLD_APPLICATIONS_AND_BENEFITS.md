## 🚀 How to Present This in Interviews

---

### **Example Answers:**

**"Tell me about a project you worked on."**

> "I built a machine learning system to predict character matchup outcomes in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. I processed 11 million tournament records from a database, aggregated them into matchup statistics, and trained a Random Forest model that achieved 83% accuracy. The project involved data extraction, feature engineering, model selection, and building an interactive prediction tool. I learned to handle large datasets, work with multiple data sources, and iterate on solutions based on results."

**"What challenges did you face?"**

> "The biggest challenge was understanding that we needed to aggregate individual matches into matchup pairs - 11 million individual matches became 1,857 matchup records through proper data processing. I also discovered and fixed a symmetry issue where predictions changed based on input order, which taught me the importance of thorough testing. I learned to balance data quality with quantity, choosing complete records over larger incomplete datasets."

**"What skills did you develop?"**

> "I developed strong data science skills - working with large databases, feature engineering, machine learning model selection and tuning. I also improved my problem-solving by trying multiple approaches (regression vs classification) and finding the best solution. The project required end-to-end thinking from data extraction to user interface, giving me experience in complete project lifecycles."
