## 📚 What I Learned

---

### **1. Data Science is Iterative**

```
Attempt 1: Regression (R² = 6.36%) ❌
    ↓
Lesson: Wrong approach
    ↓
Attempt 2: Classification (83% accuracy) ✅
    ↓
Success: Right approach found
```

**Key Insight:** Don't commit to first solution. Iterate based on results.

---

### **2. Quality Over Quantity**

**The Numbers:**

- 11,000,167 tournament sets (raw)
- 1,857 matchups (processed)

**The Lesson:**

- Complete, reliable data beats large, messy data
- Filtering is necessary
- Quality improves results

---

### **3. Problem-Solving Process**

**Challenges Faced:**

1. ✅ Data aggregation confusion
2. ✅ Symmetry prediction issue
3. ✅ Class imbalance
4. ✅ Integration complexity

**Approach:**

- Identify problem
- Analyze root cause
- Develop solution
- Validate fix

**Result:** Systematic problem-solving skills developed

## 🚧 Challenges & Solutions

---

### **Challenge 1: Symmetry Problem**

**Problem:**

- "Mario vs Fox" ≠ "Fox vs Mario" predictions
- Order shouldn't matter!

**Solution:**

- Predict both directions
- Average probabilities
- Ensures consistency

**Learning:** Always test edge cases and assumptions.

---

### **Challenge 2: Data Reduction**

**Question:**

- "Why only 1,857 from 11M sets?"

**Answer:**

- Aggregation: Many matches → One matchup pair
- This is normal and necessary
- Quality filtering improves results

**Learning:** Understand your data transformations.

---

### **Challenge 3: Model Performance**

**Observation:**

- 83% accuracy on recent data ✅
